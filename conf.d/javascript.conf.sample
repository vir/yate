; The file name should hold either the absolute path and name or the path
;  and name relative to the scripts_dir in section [general]
; Examples:
;  faxes=fax_handler.js
;  callback=js_lib/callback.js

; The Eliza chat bot, enabled by default for your enjoyment in rmanager

;  after the dispatching of the "engine.start" message.
; The names must be unique and different from any in the [scripts] section.
